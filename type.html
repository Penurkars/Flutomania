		1.Bansuri(Indian Flute):- A bansuri is a side blown flute originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is an aerophone produced from bamboo, used in Hindustani classical music. It is referred to as nadi and tunava in the Rigveda and other Vedic texts of Hinduism. Its importance and operation is discussed in the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra.

		A bansuri is traditionally made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with six or seven finger holes. Some modern designs come in ivory, fiberglass and various metals. The six hole instrument covers two and a half octaves of music. The bansuri is typically between 30 centimetres (12 in) and 75 centimetres (30 in) in length, and the thickness of a human thumb. One end is closed, and few centimeters from the closed end is its blow hole. Longer bansuris feature deeper tones and lower pitches. The traditional design features no mechanical keys, and the musician creates the notes he wants by tapping the various finger holes.

		The bansuri-like flute is depicted in ancient Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temple paintings and reliefs, and is common in the iconography of the Hindu god Krishna. it is intimately linked to the love story of Krishna and Radha. The bansuri is revered as Lord Krishna's divine instrument and is often associated with Krishna's Rasa lila dance. These legends sometimes use alternate names for this wind instrument, such as the murali. However, the instrument is also common among other traditions such as Shaivism. The early medieval Indian texts also refer to it as vaṃśi, while in medieval Indonesian Hindu and Buddhist arts, as well as temple carvings in Java and Bali dated to be from pre-10th century period, this transverse flute has been called wangsi or bangsi.

		2.Standard Flute:- Standard flutes are available for all levels and abilities. This makes them a great instrument to learn. You can purchase Sonata and Nuvo flutes at great prices. Along with great Yamaha packages available as well.

		Standard flute is about 2 feet long and made of silver, gold or platinum. When played in an orchestra the flute usually plays the melody.

		Our most popular flute is the Sonata, which is available as a standard straight-head model, or for the younger/smaller player, as a curved-head model (which also contains the straight head for when the child grows!). 

		Higher-end, semi-professional Flutes have the same key structure and design, but the added quality is achieved through the use of a solid silver headjoint; precious metal = precious and deeper tone! You will not find bwetter value for money when looking for this sold silver variant, than the wonderful Montreux Flute.

		3.Piccolo Flute:- The piccolo is a lot smaller in length compared to the flute. Did you know that piccolo means small in Italian? The smallest of the flute family, the piccolo measures approximately half the length of the concert flute. It’s the highest pitched flute (in the key of C) sounding an octave higher than the concert flute when played. Concert band music often has a piccolo part and so this is a common instrument for flute players to double on. Piccolos can be made from a variety of metals and most commonly the hardwood grenadilla. There is some solo repertoire, concertos and chamber music written for piccolos. The timbre of the piccolo can be described as clear, brilliant and graceful in its middle register, and piercing and shrill when played loudly in its upper register.

		4.Plastic Flute:- The plastic flute is great and allows younger children to get involved and learn this great instrument. It’s suitable for all levels; although most commonly used for beginners due to its “first note” mouthpiece. This allows the player to get a good sound when they first play.

		The interchangeable parts means the instrument can be used at different levels- from beginner to advanced. Meaning it’s adaptable and can last a bit longer as the player improves.

		They are available in lots of great bright colours. It’s lightweight, durable and easy to keep clean.
